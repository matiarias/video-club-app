# VideoClub App

Movies app with a Netflix vibes. For the data requests i used The Movie Database Api. I Built the entire app with React.js, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Firebase and React-router-dom. You can sign up and sign in with Firebase Auth and I used firestore to save movies into a firestore database.
